        Steps:
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine onion, lime juice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and saffron in a large glass bowl. Mix in olive oil. Press chicken into the bowl lightly and cover with plastic wrap. Let marinate for 6 hours to overnight, mixing every few hours to make sure chicken is coated.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bowl, shake off excess marinade, and discard marinade left in the bowl. Place chicken onto metal skewers, making sure it's not too tightly packed.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook skewers on the preheated grill until chicken is browned and no longer pink in the center, turning as needed, 10 to 15 minutes total.

        </li>
    </ol>
